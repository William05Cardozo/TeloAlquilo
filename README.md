# Capstone Project

## TeloAlquilo APP

TeloAlquilo is an app created by WAS Code in which its main function is the rental and purchase of real estate, we focus on generating a good performance, a friendly and easy to use app, a more optimal communication with landlords.
The idea was born after knowing several negative factors such as the lack of time that makes the task of looking for a house tedious, we also found shortcomings in other applications which we took advantage of to create a more optimized app.
